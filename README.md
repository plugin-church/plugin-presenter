# Plugin Presenter

An incredibly basic web based presentation like Power Point, Pro Presenter, or Proclaim, specifically made for song lyrics. Just find the lyrics, copy and paste them into the lyrics, and hit start and you're good to go!

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
